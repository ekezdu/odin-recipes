    <h1>CURRY RECIPE</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My personal take on japanese curry, using the typical golden curry packet, rice, potatoes, and carrots. I generally cook it in bulk, and freeze the rest in portions, and save a bit to eat for lunch or dinner the next day. My whole family loves it, but be sure to keep in mind the spice level when cooking for others. I have found that in the US, for some reason, mild and hot are much milder than overseas.</p>

    <h2>EQUIPMENT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large pot, preferably a stew pot</li>
        <li>Stovetop</li>
        <li>Knives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Golden Curry packet of your desired level</li>
        <li>3 medium-large potatoes quartered</li>
        <li>3 medium-large carrots cut into ½ inch coins</li>
        <li>Medium yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>Maggi seasoning</li>
        <li>1-2 lbs of beef, you can use ground beef, but I prefer chuck beef, cut into 1 inch squares</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>(Optional) 3 cremini mushrooms minced</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>If not using mushrooms, I recommend umami seasoning</li>
        <li>(Optional)1 tablespoon mirin,red wine or rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Cornstarch, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using beef chuck, sear beef in the large pot of your choosing on high heat.</li>
        <li>While searing, make a cornstarch-water slush with equal parts 2 tablespoons cornstarch and water.</li>
        <li>After searing, lower heat to medium-high. Add onions, mushrooms, and half the cornstarch slush. Continue cooking and stirring until onions are clear.</li>
        <li>Add entire pack of Golden curry, and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir regularly until the curry has broken apart. It likely wont dissolve completely.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes, carrots, water, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, Maggi seasoning, mirin (or alternative) to pot and stir.</li>
        <li>Cook on medium until meat, potatoes, and carrots are all tender, and stew is thickened. Add corn starch as needed to thicken stew. (About 2-3 hours)</li>
    </ol>
